# Tanknite

This game was created in a collaborative team as part of a degree project. 

The task was to design, plan, and implement a Java based game. The project had to result in a working game, a software document, and a presentation!

Note: This is a re-upload of part of the work as the account used for commits was tied to a university account and I can no longer get access. If you search for Tanknite you can see the other!
